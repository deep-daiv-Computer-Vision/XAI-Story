Bubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        # Last i elements are already in place\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n\n# Example usage"
